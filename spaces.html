            <p>You can get a lot of things done at the SU Building. Those are the most important facilities, at least in our opinion.</p>

                <h3>SSiD</h3>
                <p>
                    It is a information service for students. They can get help with general inquiries and issues such as bank documents, problems with their U-card and other problems they may face. Their shop at SU Building provides Whereas students would normally need to visit the appropriate department to get help, the SSiD can help greatly by being a mediator. This allows students to visit the SSiD to get help no matter what the problem is related to.
